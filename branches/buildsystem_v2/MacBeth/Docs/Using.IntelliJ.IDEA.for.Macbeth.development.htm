    <h1>Using IntelliJ IDEA for Macbeth development</h1>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    Download the most recent IntelliJ IDEA upgrade from <a href="http://www.intellij.com/download/idea/freeUpgrade">
    http://www.intellij.com/download/idea/freeUpgrade</a>. This is the full version, but it does of course require
    that you have a serial number, so keep your serial number ready the first time you start IDEA. The installation
    is very straight forward. Nothing particular to keep in mind there.

    <h2>Basic Configuration</h2>
    <p>Now you need to configure IDEA to use the Java SDK you have installed on your system (if you don't have
    the SDK installed yet, just visit <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a> to download and
    install the latest J2SE SDK before going on!)</p>
    <p>Open the Macbeth project file with IDEA. Then choose <span class="mark_red">File->Project Properties</span>.
    Go to the Paths-dialog and locate the drop-down list called <span class="mark_red">"Target JDK"</span>. This is
    a list of the JDKs you have installed, and to get your installed Java SDK to show up here, you need to press the
    <span class="mark_red">"..."-button</span> and then press the <span class="mark_red">"+"-button</span> in the
    dialog box that shows up. Next, <span class="mark_red">locate your J2SDK-directory</span> (typically "C:\j2sdk1.4.2_03")
    and press OK until you're back to the Project Properties dialog. Now, in the drop-down list, choose the JDK you just
    configured and press OK.</p>
    <p>IntelliJ IDEA is now ready for Macbeth development! You should be able to compile everything without
    any errors.</p>

    <h2>Code style</h2>
    <p>If you plan to participate in Macbeth development, you should make sure you follow the code style
    guidelines. Since IDEA does quite a lot of work for you while you're writing code, you might want to
    make sure IDEA follows these guidelines as well. As a bare minimum, make sure that at least the settings
    shown in the dialog below are set equally in your configuration (This is the <span class="mark_red">
    Options->IDE Settings</span> dialog)</p>
