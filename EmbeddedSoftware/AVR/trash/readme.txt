All AVR-source code is written for the GNU toolchain. Each folder in this directory represents a software project, and each project can be built separately.

Most projects depend on the "lib" project, which is a common library for the AVR platform. The goal is to maintain this library as a stand-alone project that is built into a static C library (libAVR.a).
